Exercise 1

Part 1
EXERCISE 1:
Pick a game you know well, and perform a similar analysis (it can be a computer
game or a physical one, but one that is not too complex -maybe as complex as poker):
1. Describe the nouns and verbs there are in this game.
In Sorry! there are Pieces, Squares, Dice roller, final “home” squares, Start square, and Slide squares. You can take actions like Roll dice, Move piece, Attack piece, Get out of jail, Enter home, Win.
2. Describe the gameplay of playing the game.
Players start with a set number of pieces which begin in the start square of their respective colors. Players take turns rolling the dice in the center of the board to determine what actions they can take during their turn. They must roll doubles to get a piece out of start. Once they get pieces out of start they can move however many spaces as the number they rolled on the piece of their choice. The player’s goal is to get all of their pieces around the map to their designated home space. Along the way other players can reset your progress by landing on one of your pieces with theirs sending your piece to start. The first person to get all of their pieces to Home wins.
3. Describe the player’s experience of playing. What makes it enjoyable?
When playing sorry there is a sense of competition and limited strategy. The game also leaves room for personal vendetta when players choose to attack each other in the form of alliances and revenge. It is also a game of chance so players get excited to see what they role as it is an unknown.

EXERCISE 2:
Take the game you described in Exercise 1. Now consider elements other than mechanics and gameplay that affect the experience of playing the game. What are they? What kinds of categories do they fall into?
A big factor that effects the experience of Sorry! Is the design of its board with the red, yellow, blue color scheme. It adds to the competition as you can see when other players “enter your territory.” Also my board came with a spring loaded dice roller where you push down on the plastic and when you release the dice would spring up and bounce around their plastic container. This action was fun in itself adding to the overall experience of the game.

Part 2
EXERCISE 1:
Pick one of your favorite games. Write down:
1. Why do you enjoy playing it?
I play Legend of Zelda games largely for the story. I’ve always enjoyed exploring that kind of world and interacting with its characters.
2. What do you enjoy about it that other people might not?
I also like the art style which may not be as appealing to people you enjoy life-like graphics.
3. What could other people enjoy about it that you don’t?
Many people enjoy the games for the difficulty of their dungeons which is not as compelling for me. If I get stuck on a part for too long I will look up a solution to continue with the story.

EXERCISE 2:
Two parts:
1.Take the game you described in Exercise 1 and dig deeper into why you find it
enjoyable. List as many reasons as you can. Also list things that you don’t find
enjoyable.
Things I find enjoyable in Legend of Zelda are the: characters, story, world design, visual art style, music and sound effects, gameplay and combat mechanics, progression, immersion. Things I didn’t find enjoyable: maybe frustrating to get lost in a dungeon. I did not find many things in these games unenjoyable
2.Categorize your list based on whether they’re gameplay, content, and/or presentation. If
some elements belong in multiple categories equally, call that out as well.
Content: characters, story, immersion
Presentation: world design, visual art style, music and sound effects, immersion
Gameplay and mechanics: gear progression, combat

EXERCISE 3:
Consider some multiplayer game that
you’ve played (online or local multiplayer).
Do you see Bartle types reflected in players in that game? Do you fit into one or several of the types? Or are you motivated by things that Bartle’s model doesn’t capture?
In my limited experience I’ve seen the Bartle types reflected in multiplayer games. I believe I fit under the Achiever category usually, but if I am playing a game with my immediate friends the competition may lead me to be more of a Killer.

EXERCISE 4:
Go back to your favorite game,
imagine and write out user personas for the variety of players who would enjoy this game, who they are, and how they fit the game into their lives. Think beyond your own experience, and try to imagine a variety of players from different walks of life: who are they?
- Eric is a Nintendo fan is his early twenties that has bought every installment since he got the N64 when he was 8. After work he allocates time when a new game comes out and he binges until completion. He is always excited to experience a new addition to the overarching game story.
- Noah is a twelve year old kid who likes gaming but his parents won’t get him Call of Duty, the game all of his friends play. Instead he is stuck playing Legend of Zelda where he mostly just goes around attacking enemies and violently smashing pots.
- Mia is a seventeen year old girl who if ever asked would call herself a casual gamer. She has all the classic games and most of the new installments, but has oddly never beaten any of them. She tells herself she will get back to them, but the most she can do is play the newest for a couple hours on the weekend before she is overtaken by a busy schedule. When she does play she enjoys exploring places she’s never been before.

EXERCISE 5:
Consider your own game playing habits. Which of these 12 motivations reflect
your own motivations the most? Which of them are you indifferent to? Are there any that you actively dislike and avoid games that have them?
In games I find myself having motivations of Community, Power, Story, and Discovery. I am indifferent to Fantasy and Destruction as I think they play supportive roles to the other motivations. I tend to shy away from Design, Competition and Challenge because of the mush larger time commitment which I feel like I can’t accommodate for in my life.

EXERCISE 6:
Consider one of the games you know well, and answer these above three
questions about that game, putting yourself in the game designer’s shoes
1. Who am I making the game for?
For EA’s Star Wars Battlefront they made the game for players excited about the resurgence of the Star Wars brand. They made it casual, but also true to form for its universe. Rabid Star Wars fans want to get there hands on anything Star Wars so marketing was specifically trying to cast a wide net.
2. What will they enjoy about this game?
The game caters to motivations of Destruction, Competition, Community, Excitement and Fantasy. Fans want to immerse themselves in the battle of the universe they love in a game with much better graphical fidelity than the last installment.
3. What else would they enjoy that’s not in the game? What would they not enjoy?
I believe gamers would appreciate more strategy over the casual style. Also a single player story experience would add to the player experience. They might not enjoy appeals to Power as it may go against the well known rules of the Star Wars universe.

EXERCISE 7:
Like in other media, it’s seemingly impossible to make a game that tries to be all things to all people. Can you think of a game that tried satisfying very different players and failed - or succeeded? Analyze it in terms of player motivations, and which ones were fulfilled
successfully or unsuccessfully.
EA’s Spore tried to be all things for all people. It separated the game into different stages: cell, primal, tribal, civilization, and space. Each stage was essentially had different motivations where everything felt casual, besides the space stage which was the most fleshed out and different. The other stages were not compelling when compared to games available that appealed to their respective motivations. An example is the tribal stage which was an RTS that pales in comparison to games like Age of Empires.  Thus most people only spent their time in the final stage or switched to a different game.

EXERCISE 8:
Pick a genre you’re familiar with. Which of the Yee’s player motivations would
you expect to be satisfied by games in this genre? Which motivations are less related to the genre?
The multiplayer first person shooter satisfies motivations like Destruction, Excitement, Competition, Community and Fantasy. I’d say it is less related to Design, Discovery and Story

EXERCISE 9:
Can you think of a cross-genre game
that you’re familiar with? Does it satisfy the same player motivations as those genres in separation?
Mass Effect is shooter RPG. It is able to not only satisfy the Destruction and Excitement common to shooters, but also the Story, Discovery and Fantasy of RPGs. It does, however, give the option to players who do not want to play it as a shooter so its cross-genre nature may depend on play style.

Part 3
EXERCISE 1:
Two parts:
1.Consider a computer game that you like. List some of the implicit mechanics, that the player only learns over time.
When you play Pokemon each one you capture has its own hidden initial values and effort values. Both these set of numbers effect the strength of the Pokemon and can be improved through breeding or chaining. Not while this has become more explicit in recent games in earlier generations it was completely implicit. Also in these games you had to learn the types of the Pokemon you were facing and the different strengths and weaknesses of one type over another all learned through trial and error or interacting with the world.

2.Consider what would happen if you made the player aware of these mechanics right
from the beginning - how would that change their experience?
It would remove the learning curve of the game possibly taking away some of the mystery of the universe. The game may be easier for some players that know the type differences, EVs and IVs and how to use them to their advantage.

EXERCISE 2:
Consider some favorite action game, not necessarily a fighting - oriented one, but
one played with a console controller. What are the inputs that it uses, and how do they translate into game actions? How does it use analog vs digital buttons? How does it use simple vs directional inputs? How do inputs translate into position, velocity, or acceleration changes?
Mortal Kombat use the directional controls (sticks or D-pad) to determine where the player will move. The player can move in eight directions (including front-up, down-back etc.) across a 2d space. The speed is at a constant velocity in the front back direction, and jumping follows a normal gravitational model. The fighting game treats all inputs as digital buttons and sticks alike. Pressing buttons will have the character performing different moves and combos if made in succession.

EXERCISE 3:
Based on Costikyan’s book, go back to the game you picked in Exercise 1 or 2,
and describe what types of uncertainty are present in that game.
In Pokemon you are never sure what Pokemon you will encounter in the wild adding uncertainty due to randomness. Also strategy during battle in the form of predicting what moves the other Pokemon has and which is the best way to defeat it add uncertainty in the forms of Anticipation and Complexity.

EXERCISE 4:
Pick a game you like. What kind of progression mechanics does it use, to give the player feedback on their progression in the game? Are these mechanics successful in bringing players back to the game, and to keep playing it?
In Pokemon when you defeat gyms you get badges, collectibles that you can view on your trainer card. The badges show you how close you are to defeating Elite Four and beating the game. Having these is like the carrot on the stick reminding the player how far they’ve come and how close they are to their goal.

EXERCISE 5:
Consider some web sites or
products with a scoring system, maybe like Stack Overflow, or Facebook and Twitter with their likes and shares. Discuss why or why not you think that works as a progression mechanic, and how successful they are in 1. giving the recipient feedback about how
they’re doing (at what activity?) and 2. driving them to participate more.
On social media sites there is often a scoring system that allows feedback for participatory actions like posting and commenting. This works as it lets peers judge their actions and validation from actual people is a very powerful way to continue to motivate the user to participate.

EXERCISE 6:
Pick some game you’re familiar with. Describe some of the units in the game,
and how stats are used to differentiate those units and their abilities. Does the game make use of any stat modifiers, and if so, in what way?
In Pokemon there is a clear differentiation between a legendary and a normal Pokemon in the form of their stats. Even at the same level the legendary’s stats will be much stronger. Also depending on what type of Pokemon it is it may have higher defense or attack. Even within the same type due to IVs and EVs Pokemon may have different stats. Pokemon includes stat modifiers in the form of items. Certain items have effects that benefit the Pokemon in battle for instance by increasing its critical hit ratio.

Part 4
EXERCISE 1:
Both mechanics and systems are building blocks of game design, but they differ
in scale and composition. How do you differentiate between mechanics and systems? Give an example of a game system, and the mechanics that make it up.
Systems are the over arching idea that you want implemented in the game and mechanics are the specific implementations that together form the system. The progression system is found through Class Customization in the Call of Duty franchise. The mechanics behind it are that you can customize your load out before a battle. You can unlock further customization by completing challenges in battle. Then after you can update you load out with the great you unlocked. Thus forming a cycle of progression.

EXERCISE 2:
Pick a computer game you know very well. Try to write down as many of the
systems in the game that you can think of, with short descriptions of what they do (only a sentence or two each).
In Minecraft there are: the crafting system where the player can create new items using gathered materials, gathering system where you can get materials from the environment using a variety of tools, the world generation system by which the world is procedurally generated, the combat system where players can kill enemies, the inventory system where the player keeps their tools and materials, the building system where players can place collected materials, and the player system that keeps track of experience, position and whether the player has died.

EXERCISE 3:
Pick a game you know well. Find a resource loop in that game (there may be
multiple, so pick just one) and describe it in detail. Do you see profitable or unprofitable loops? Is there a profitable loop that could lead to runaway resource creation? Why or why not?
Mining in Minecraft gives players the opportunity to find rare resources used to build better tools. Mining requires tools and torches which both require wood and a crafting space. Players also have limited inventory space so when they find rare materials they go store it at home. Thus a common resources loop for Minecraft looks life collecting wood->home(crafting)->mining->home(storage)->repeat. There isn’t a way to have runaway resource generation due to the degrading nature of tools and the fact that you can’t convert one material into another through trade, for instance.

EXERCISE 4:
The term grinding often refers to going through resource loops just to gain resources, or to improve stats, but where the actual activity is not enjoyable or interesting. Can you think of a game in which you were grinding for something and not having fun? Describe that resource chain, and your own motivation for going through it.
In Pokemon you gain experience every time you defeat a mon in battle. So if you are at a stage in the game where you need to gain a few levels with a certain Pokemon to be able to compete you have to mindlessly walk through the tall grass to find a wild encounter and easily defeat them for experience. When your Pokemon gets low on health you must return to he Pokemon Center for healing and you repeat the process until the Pokemon is the desired level. The battles have no strategy or difficulty because usually they are lower level. The motivation for spending time training like this is to be able to take on the more difficult gym battles.

EXERCISE 5:
Describe a game that exhibits a strong positive feedback loop. How does the
feedback loop amplify the production of some resources based on its previous output?
Cookie clicker is a highly addictive click game that uses a strong positive feedback loop. Players click the cookie to get enough cookies to buy things that automatically generate cookies. Eventually all clicking is abandoned and players instead resort to managing their upgrades. Each upgrade has an exponential effect on production past current output so the only way to advance meaningfully is to closely manage upgrades.

EXERCISE 6:
Imagine that you
change the game in Exercise 5, so that the feedback loop is negative rather than positive. Is it possible? If so, what changes would you make?
I would designate specific cookie regions whose cookies resources inevitably run dry so you must invest in exploration into new cookie regions whose resources are untapped. So the player will feel under pressure when their current regions are running out but relieved when the discovery team comes through.

EXERCISE 7:
Pick a competitive multiplayer game. Does it have an economy or resource production that forms a positive feedback loop? How does this affect the conflict and resolution phases?
Civilization 5 forms a positive resource loop in the amount of tiles or land players are able to control. More resources from tiles means faster progression through the technology trees and larger military build up. In military conflict the civ with the most tiles and resources will have the advantage. However, the game counters this with alternative strategies, including the possibility of a religious or cultural victory that may lead to an unexpected conclusion at the end of the resolution phase.

EXAMPLE 8:
Think of a game with a strong source of randomness. Does it have a detrimental
effect on early game and player’s strategy, or is it integrated in such a way that player’s abilities
can still make a large difference?
Dominos is a game with a strong source of randomness. If a player gets a back hand it is detrimental, but the way the game is played players don’t fully realize it is a bad hand until the match is already over. This creates a feeling that strategy has a large impact on who wins and loses.
